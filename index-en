        <h1>The Node Beginner Book</h1>

        <div id="author">A Node.js tutorial by <a href="http://twitter.com/manuelkiessling">Manuel Kiessling</a></div>

        <a name="about"></a>

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            The aim of this document is to get you started with developing
            applications with Node.js, teaching you everything you need to
            know about "advanced" JavaScript along the way. It goes way
            beyond your typical "Hello World" tutorial.
        </p>

        <a name="status"></a>

        <h3>Status</h3>

        <p>
            You are reading the final version of this book, i.e., updates
            are only done to correct errors or to reflect changes in new
            versions of Node.js. It was last updated on September 9, 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code samples in this book are tested to work with Node.js
            version 0.8.8.
        </p>

        <a name="intended-audience"></a>

        <h3>Intended audience</h3>

        <p>
            This document will probably fit best for readers that have a
            background similar to my own: experienced with at least one
            object-oriented language like Ruby, Python, PHP or Java, only little
            experience with JavaScript, and completely new to Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aiming at developers that already have experience with other
            programming languages means that this document won't cover
            really basic stuff like data types, variables, control structures
            and the likes. You already need to know about these to understand
            this document.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, because functions and objects in JavaScript are different
            from their counterparts in most other languages, these will be
            explained in more detail.
        </p>

        <a name="structure"></a>

        <h3>Structure of this document</h3>

        <p>
            Upon finishing this document, you will have created a complete web
            application which allows the users of this application to view web
            pages and upload files.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which, of course, is not exactly
            world-changing, but we will go some extra miles and not only create
            the code that is "just enough" to make these use cases possible,
            but create a simple, yet complete framework to cleanly separate the
            different aspects of our application. You will see what I mean in a
            minute.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will start with looking at how JavaScript development in Node.js
            is different from JavaScript development in a browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we will stay with the good old tradition of writing a "Hello
            World" application, which is a most basic Node.js application that
            "does" something.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, we will discuss what kind of "real" application we want to
            build, dissect the different parts which need to be implemented to
            assemble this application, and start working on each of these parts
            step-by-step.
        </p>

        <p>
            As promised, along the way we will learn about some of the more
            advanced concepts of JavaScript, how to make use of them, and
            look at why it makes sense to use these concepts instead of
            those we know from other programming languages.
        </p>

        <p>

            <a href="https://github.com/ManuelKiessling/NodeBeginnerBook/tree/master/code/application">the

        <h2>JavaScript and Node.js</h2>

        <a name="javascript-and-you"></a>

        <h3>JavaScript and You</h3>

        <p>
            Before we talk about all the technical stuff, let's take a
            moment and talk about you and your relationship with
            JavaScript. This chapter is here to allow you to estimate
            if reading this document any further makes sense for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are like me, you started with HTML "development"
            long ago, by writing HTML documents. You came along this
            funny thing called JavaScript, but you only used it in a
            very basic way, adding interactivity to your web pages
            every now and then.
        </p>

        <p>
            What you really wanted was "the real thing", you wanted to
            know how to build complex web sites - you learned a
            programming language like PHP, Ruby, Java, and started
            writing "backend" code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nevertheless, you kept an eye on JavaScript, you saw that
            with the introduction of jQuery, Prototype and the likes,
            things got more advanced in JavaScript land, and that this
            language really was about more than <em>window.open()</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, this was all still frontend stuff, and although it
            was nice to have jQuery at your disposal whenever you felt
            like spicing up a web page, at the end of the day you were,
            at best, a JavaScript <em>user</em>, but not a JavaScript
            <em>developer</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            And then came Node.js. JavaScript on the server, how cool
            is that?
        </p>

        <p>
            You decided that it's about time to check out the old, new
            JavaScript. But wait, writing Node.js applications is the
            one thing; understanding why they need to be written the
            way they are written means - understanding JavaScript.
            And this time for real.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is the problem: Because JavaScript really lives two,
            maybe even three lives (the funny little DHTML helper from
            the mid-90's, the more serious frontend stuff like jQuery
            and the likes, and now server-side), it's not that easy to
            find information that helps you to learn JavaScript the
            "right" way, in order to write Node.js applications in a
            fashion that makes you feel you are not just using
            JavaScript, you are actually developing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because that's the catch: you already are an experienced
            developer, you don't want to learn a new technique by just
            hacking around and mis-using it; you want to be sure that
            you are approaching it from the right angle.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is, of course, excellent documentation out there.
            But documentation alone sometimes isn't enough. What is
            needed is guidance.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to provide a guide for you.
        </p>

        <h3>A word of warning</h3>

        <p>
            There are some really excellent JavaScript people out
            there. I'm not one of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm really just the guy I talked about in the previous
            paragraph. I know a thing or two about developing backend
            web applications, but I'm still new to "real" JavaScript
            and still new to Node.js. I learned some of the more
            advanced aspects of JavaScript just recently.
            I'm not experienced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which is why this is no "from novice to expert" book. It's
            more like "from novice to advanced novice".
        </p>

        <p>
            If I don't fail, then this will be the kind of
            document I wish I had when starting with Node.js.
        </p>

        <a name="server-side-javascript"></a>

        <h3>Server-side JavaScript</h3>

        <p>
            The first incarnations of JavaScript lived in browsers.
            But this is just the context. It defines what you can
            do with the language, but it doesn't say much about what
            the language itself can do. JavaScript is a "complete"
            language: you can use it in many contexts and achieve
            everything with it you can achieve with any other
            "complete" language.
        </p>

        <p>
            Node.js really is just another context: it allows you to run
            JavaScript code in the backend, outside a browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to execute the JavaScript you intend to run in the
            backend, it needs to be interpreted and, well, executed.
            This is what Node.js does, by making use of Google's V8 VM, the
            same runtime environment for JavaScript that Google
            Chrome uses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plus, Node.js ships with a lot of useful modules, so you don't
            have to write everything from scratch, like for example
            something that outputs a string on the console.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, Node.js is really two things: a runtime environment and a
            library.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to make use of these, you need to install Node.js.
            Instead of repeating the process here, I kindly ask you to
            visit
            <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation" title="Building and Installing Node.js">the
                official
                installation instructions</a>. Please come back once you
            are up and running.
        </p>

        <a name="hello-world"></a>

        <h3>"Hello World"</h3>

        <p>
            Ok, let's just jump in the cold water and write our first
            Node.js application: "Hello World".
        </p>

        <p>
            Open your favorite editor and create a file called
            <em>helloworld.js</em>. We want it to write "Hello World"
            to STDOUT, and here is the code needed to do that:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="pln">console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Hello World"</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>
        <p>
            Save the file, and execute it through Node.js:
        </p>

        <pre>node helloworld.js</pre>
        <p>
            This should output <em>Hello World</em> on your terminal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, this stuff is boring, right? Let's write some real
            stuff.
        </p>


        <a name="a-full-blown-web-application-with-nodejs"></a>

        <h2>A full blown web application with Node.js</h2>

        <a name="the-use-cases"></a>

        <h3>The use cases</h3>

        <p>
            Let's keep it simple, but realistic:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                The user should be able to use our application with
                a web browser
            </li>
            <li>
                The user should see a welcome page when
                requesting http://<em>domain</em>/start which displays a
                file upload form
            </li>
            <li>
                By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the
                form, this image should then be uploaded to
                http://<em>domain</em>/upload, where it is displayed once
                the upload is finished
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Fair enough. Now, you could achieve this goal by googling
            and hacking together <em>something</em>. But that's not
            what we want to do here.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, we don't want to write only the most basic
            code to achieve the goal, however elegant and correct this code
            might be. We will intentionally add more abstraction than
            necessary in order to get a feeling for building more
            complex Node.js applications.
        </p>

        <a name="the-application-stack"></a>

        <h3>The application stack</h3>

        <p>
            Let's dissect our application. Which parts need to be
            implemented in order to fulfill the use cases?
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                We want to serve web pages, therefore we need an
                <strong>HTTP server</strong>
            </li>

            <li>
                Our server will need to answer differently to
                requests, depending on which URL the request was
                asking for, thus we need some kind of
                <strong>router</strong> in order to map requests
                to request handlers
            </li>
            <li>
                To fullfill the requests that arrived at the server
                and have been routed using the router, we need
                actual <strong>request handlers</strong>
            </li>
            <li>

                The router probably should also treat any incoming
                POST data and give it to the request handlers in
                a convenient form, thus we need <strong>request
                data handling</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                We not only want to handle requests for URLs, we
                also want to display content when these URLs are
                requested, which means we need some kind of
                <strong>view logic</strong> the request handlers
                can use in order to send content to the user's
                browser
            </li>
            <li>
                Last but not least, the user will be able to upload
                images, so we are going to need some kind of
                <strong>upload handling</strong> which takes care of
                the details
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Let's think a moment about how we would build this stack
            with PHP. It's not exactly a secret that the typical setup
            would be an Apache HTTP server with mod_php5 installed.
            <br>
            Which in turn means that the whole "we need to be able to
            serve web pages and receive HTTP requests" stuff doesn't
            happen within PHP itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, with node, things are a bit different. Because with
            Node.js, we not only implement our application, we also
            implement the whole HTTP server. In fact, our web
            application and its web server are basically the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            This might sound like a lot of work, but we will see in a
            moment that with Node.js, it's not.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's just start at the beginning and implement the first
            part of our stack, the HTTP server.
        </p>

        <a name="building-the-application-stack"></a>

        <h2>Building the application stack</h2>

        <a name="a-basic-http-server"></a>

        <h3>A basic HTTP server</h3>

        <p>
            When I arrived at the point where I wanted to start with my
            first "real" Node.js application, I wondered not only how to
            actually code it, but also how to organize my code.
            <br>
            Do I need to have everything in one file? Most tutorials on
            the web that teach you how to write a basic HTTP server in
            Node.js have all the logic in one place. What if I want to
            make sure that my code stays readable the more stuff I
            implement?
        </p>

        <p>
            Turns out, it's relatively easy to keep the different
            concerns of your code separated, by putting them in
            modules.
        </p>

        <p>
            This allows you to have a clean main file, which you
            execute with Node.js, and clean modules that can be used by
            the main file and among each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, let's create a main file which we use to start our
            application, and a module file where our HTTP server code
            lives.
        </p>

        <p>
            My impression is that it's more or less a standard to name
            your main file <em>index.js</em>. It makes sense to put our
            server module into a file named <em>server.js</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start with the server module. Create the file
            <em>server.js</em> in the root directory of your project,
            and fill it with the following code:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br>http</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">createServer</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="kwd">function</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">request</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> response</span><span
                class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">writeHead</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="lit">200</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
                class="pun">{</span><span class="str">"Content-Type"</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"text/plain"</span><span class="pun">});</span><span
                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">write</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Hello World"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span
                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">end</span><span
                class="pun">();</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}).</span><span
                class="pln">listen</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">8888</span><span
                class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            That's it! You just wrote a working HTTP server. Let's
            prove it by running and testing it. First, execute your
            script with Node.js:
        </p>
        <pre>node server.js</pre>
        <p>
            Now, open your browser and point it at
            <a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>.
            This should display a web page that says "Hello World".
        </p>

        <p>
            That's quite interesting, isn't it. How about talking about
            what's going on here and leaving the question of how to
            organize our project for later? I promise we'll get back to
            it.
        </p>

        <a name="analyzing-our-http-server"></a>

        <h3>Analyzing our HTTP server</h3>

        <p>
            Well, then, let's analyze what's actually going on here.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first line <em>require</em>s the <em>http</em> module
            that ships with Node.js and makes it accessible through the
            variable <em>http</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We then call one of the functions the http module offers:
            <em>createServer</em>. This function returns an object, and
            this object has a method named <em>listen</em>, and takes
            a numeric value which indicates the port number our HTTP
            server is going to listen on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please ignore for a second the function definition that
            follows the opening bracket of <em>http.createServer</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We could have written the code that starts our server and
            makes it listen at port 8888 like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="kwd">var</span><span
                class="pln"> server </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> http</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">createServer</span><span class="pun">();</span><span
                class="pln"><br>server</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">listen</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="lit">8888</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            That would start an HTTP server listening at port 8888
            and doing nothing else (not even answering any incoming
            requests).
        </p>

        <p>
            The really interesting (and, if your background is a more
            conservative language like PHP, odd looking) part is the
            function definition right there where you would expect the
            first parameter of the <em>createServer()</em> call.
        </p>

        <p>
            Turns out, this function definition IS the first (and only)
            parameter we are giving to the <em>createServer()</em>

            call. Because in JavaScript, functions can be passed around
            like any other value.
        </p>

        <a name="passing-functions-around"></a>

        <h3>Passing functions around</h3>

        <p>
            You can, for example, do something like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> say</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">word</span><span class="pun">)</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="pln">word</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span
                class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> execute</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">someFunction</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> value</span><span
                class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; someFunction</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">value</span><span class="pun">);</span><span
                class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>execute</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">say</span><span class="pun">,</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"Hello"</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Read this carefully! What we are doing here is, we pass the
            function <em>say</em> as the first parameter to the
            <em>execute</em> function. Not the return value of
            <em>say</em>, but <em>say</em> itself!
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, <em>say</em> becomes the local variable
            <em>someFunction</em> within <em>execute</em>, and execute
            can call the function in this variable by issuing
            <em>someFunction()</em> (adding brackets).
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, because <em>say</em> takes one parameter,
            <em>execute</em> can pass such a parameter when calling
            <em>someFunction</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can, as we just did, pass a function as a parameter to
            another function by its name. But we don't have to take this
            indirection of first defining, then passing it - we can
            define and pass a function as a parameter to another
            function in-place:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> execute</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">someFunction</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> value</span><span

        <p>
            We define the function we want to pass to <em>execute</em>
            right there at the place where <em>execute</em> expects its
            first parameter.
        </p>

        <p>
            This way, we don't even need to give the function a name,
            which is why this is called an <em>anonymous function</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a first glimpse at what I like to call "advanced"
            JavaScript, but let's take it step by step. For now, let's
            just accept that in JavaScript, we can pass a function as
            a parameter when calling another function. We can do this
            by assigning our function to a variable, which we then
            pass, or by defining the function to pass in-place.

        <h3>How function passing makes our HTTP server work</h3>

        <p>
            With this knowledge, let's get back to our minimalistic
            HTTP server:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br>http</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">createServer</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="kwd">function</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">request</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> response</span><span
                class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">writeHead</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="lit">200</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
                class="pun">{</span><span class="str">"Content-Type"</span><span class="pun">:</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"text/plain"</span><span class="pun">});</span><span
                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">write</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Hello World"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span
                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">end</span><span
                class="pun">();</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}).</span><span
                class="pln">listen</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">8888</span><span
                class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            By now it should be clear what we are actually doing here:
            we pass the <em>createServer</em> function an anonymous
            function.
        </p>

        <p>
            We could achieve the same by refactoring our code to:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span

                class="lit">8888</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Maybe now is a good moment to ask: Why are we doing it
            that way?
        </p>

        <a name="event-driven-callbacks"></a>

        <h3>Event-driven asynchronous callbacks</h3>

        <p>
            To understand why Node.js applications have to be written this way,
            we need to understand how Node.js executes our code. Node's
            approach isn't unique, but the underlying execution model is
            different from runtime environments like Python, Ruby, PHP or Java.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's take a very simple piece of code like this:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
console.log("Hello World");</pre>

        <p>
            Please ignore for now that we haven't actually talked about
            connecting to databases before - it's just an example. The
            first line queries a database for lots of rows, the second
            line puts "Hello World" to the console.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's assume that the database query is really slow, that it has
            to read an awful lot of rows, which takes several seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            The way we have written this code, the JavaScript interpreter of
            Node.js first has to read the complete result set from the
            database, and then it can execute the <em>console.log()</em>
            function.
        </p>

        <p>
            If this piece of code actually was, say, PHP, it would work the
            same way: read all the results at once, then execute the next line
            of code. If this code would be part of a web page script, the user
            would have to wait several seconds for the page to load.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, in the execution model of PHP, this would not become a
            "global" problem: the web server starts its own PHP process for
            every HTTP request it receives. If one of these requests results
            in the execution of a slow piece of code, it results in a slow
            page load for this particular user, but other users requesting
            other pages would not be affected.
        </p>

        <p>
            The execution model of Node.js is different - there is only one
            single process. If there is a slow database query somewhere in
            this process, this affects the whole process - everything comes
            to a halt until the slow query has finished.
        </p>

        <p>
            To avoid this, JavaScript, and therefore Node.js, introduces the
            concept of event-driven, asynchronous callbacks, by utilizing an
            event loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can understand this concept by analyzing a rewritten version
            of our problematic code:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable", function(rows) {
  var result = rows;
});
console.log("Hello World");</pre>

        <p>
            Here, instead of expecting <em>database.query()</em> to directly
            return a result to us, we pass it a second parameter, an anonymous
            function.
        </p>

        <p>
            In its previous form, our code was synchronous: <em>first</em>
            do the database query, and only when this is done, <em>then</em>
            write to the console.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, Node.js can handle the database request asynchronously.
            Provided that <em>database.query()</em> is part of an asynchronous
            library, this is what Node.js does: just as before, it takes the
            query and sends it to the database. But instead of waiting for it
            to be finished, it makes a mental note that says "When at some
            point in the future the database server is done and sends the
            result of the query, then I have to execute the anonymous function
            that was passed to <em>database.query()</em>."
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, it immediately executes <em>console.log()</em>, and
            afterwards, it enters the event loop. Node.js continuously cycles
            through this loop again and again whenever there is nothing else
            to do, waiting for events. Events like, e.g., a slow database
            query finally delivering its results.
        </p>

        <p>
            This also explains why our HTTP server needs a function it can
            call upon incoming requests - if Node.js would start the server
            and then just pause, waiting for the next request, continuing
            only when it arrives, that would be highly inefficent. If a second
            user requests the server while it is still serving the first
            request, that second request could only be answered after the first
            one is done - as soon as you have more than a handful of HTTP
            requests per second, this wouldn't work at all.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's important to note that this asynchronous, single-threaded,
            event-driven execution model isn't an infinitely scalable
            performance unicorn with silver bullets attached. It is just one
            of several models, and it has its limitations, one being that as
            of now, Node.js is just one single process, and it can run on only
            one single CPU core. Personally, I find this model quite
            approachable, because it allows to write applications that have to
            deal with concurrency in an efficient and relatively
            straightforward manner.

            You might want to take the time to read Felix
            Geisendörfer's excellent post
            <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb">Understanding

            for additional background explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's play around a bit with this new concept. Can we prove
            that our code continues after creating the server, even if
            no HTTP request happened and the callback function we
            passed isn't called? Let's try it:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span

                class="pun">});</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">write</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Hello World"</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">end</span><span class="pun">();</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span
                class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>http</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">createServer</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">onRequest</span><span class="pun">).</span><span class="pln">listen</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">8888</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br>console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Server has started."</span><span
                class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Note that I use <em>console.log</em> to output a text whenever
            the <em>onRequest</em> function (our callback) is triggered,
            and another text right <em>after</em> starting the HTTP server.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we start this (<em>node server.js</em>, as always), it
            will immediately output "Server has started." on the
            command line. Whenever we request our server (by opening
            <a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>

            in our browser), the message "Request received." is printed
            on the command line.
        </p>

        <p>
            Event-driven asynchronous server-side JavaScript with
            callbacks in action :-)
        </p>

        <p>
            (Note that our server will probably write "Request received."
            to STDOUT two times upon opening the page in a browser. That's
            because most browsers will try to load the favicon by requesting
            http://localhost:8888/favicon.ico whenever you open
            http://localhost:8888/).
        </p>

        <a name="how-our-server-handles-requests"></a>

        <h3>How our server handles requests</h3>

        <p>
            Ok, let's quickly analyze the rest of our server code, that
            is, the body of our callback function <em>onRequest()</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the callback fires and our <em>onRequest()</em> function
            gets triggered, two parameters are passed into it:
            <em>request</em> and <em>response</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Those are objects, and you can use their methods to handle
            the details of the HTTP request that occured and to respond
            to the request (i.e., to actually send something over
            the wire back to the browser that requested your server).
        </p>

        <p>
            And our code does just that: Whenever a request is
            received, it uses the <em>response.writeHead()</em>
            function to send an HTTP status 200 and content-type in the
            HTTP response header, and the <em>response.write()</em>
            function to send the text "Hello World" in the HTTP
            response body.
        </p>

        <p>
            At last, we call <em>response.end()</em> to actually finish
            our response.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point, we don't care for the details of the
            request, which is why we don't use the <em>request</em>
            object at all.
        </p>

        <a name="finding-a-place-for-our-server-module"></a>

        <h3>Finding a place for our server module</h3>

        <p>
            Ok, I promised we will get back to how to organize our
            application. We have the code for a very basic HTTP server in
            the file <em>server.js</em>, and I mentioned that it's common
            to have a main file called <em>index.js</em> which is used
            to bootstrap and start our application by making use of the
            other modules of the application (like the HTTP server module
            that lives in <em>server.js</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's talk about how to make server.js a real Node.js module
            that can be used by our yet-to-be-written <em>index.js</em>
            main file.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you may have noticed, we already used modules in our code,
            like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="pun">...</span><span
                class="pln"><br><br>http</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">createServer</span><span
                class="pun">(...);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Somewhere within Node.js lives a module called "http", and we can
            make use of it in our own code by requiring it and assigning
            the result of the require to a local variable.
        </p>

        <p>
            This makes our local variable an object that carries all the
            public methods the <em>http</em> module provides.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's common practice to choose the name of the module for the
            name of the local variable, but we are free to choose whatever
            we like:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> foo </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="pun">...</span><span

                class="pun">(...);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Fine, it's clear how to make use of internal Node.js modules. How
            do we create our own modules, and how do we use them?
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's find out by turning our <em>server.js</em> script into a
            real module.
        </p>

        <p>
            Turns out, we don't have to change that much. Making some code
            a module means we need to <em>export</em> those parts of its
            functionality that we want to provide to scripts that require
            our module.
        </p>

        <p>
            For now, the functionality our HTTP server needs to export is
            simple: scripts requiring our server module simply need to
            start the server.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make this possible, we will put our server code into a
            function named <em>start</em>, and we will export this
            function:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span

                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Request received."</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">writeHead</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">200</span><span
                class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span

                class="pun">});</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; response</span><span class="pun">.</span><span

                class="pln">end</span><span class="pun">();</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="pun">}</span><span
                class="pln"><br><br>&nbsp; http</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">createServer</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">onRequest</span><span
                class="pun">).</span><span class="pln">listen</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="lit">8888</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Server has started."</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>exports</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> start</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            This way, we can now create our main file <em>index.js</em>,
            and start our HTTP there, although the code for the server is
            still in our <em>server.js</em> file.
        </p>

        <p>
            Create a file <em>index.js</em> with the following content:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> server </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"./server"</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br>server</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start</span><span
                class="pun">();</span></pre>

        <p>
            As you can see, we can use our server module just like any
            internal module: by requiring its file and assigning it to
            a variable, its exported functions become available to us.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's it. We can now start our app via our main script, and it
            still does exactly the same:
        </p>
        <pre>node index.js</pre>

        <p>
            Great, we now can put the different parts of our application
            into different files and wire them together by making them
            modules.
        </p>

        <p>
            We still have only the very first part of our application in
            place: we can receive HTTP requests. But we need to do
            something with them - depending on which URL the browser
            requested from our server, we need to react differently.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a very simple application, you could do this directly
            within the callback function <em>onRequest()</em>. But as I said,
            let's add a bit more abstraction in order to make our example
            application a bit more interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
            Making different HTTP requests point at different parts of our
            code is called "routing" - well, then, let's create a module
            called <em>router</em>.
        </p>

        <a name="whats-needed-to-route-requests"></a>

        <h3>What's needed to "route" requests?</h3>

        <p>
            We need to be able to feed the requested URL and possible
            additional GET and POST parameters into our router, and based
            on these the router then needs to be able to decide which code
            to execute (this "code to execute" is the third part of our
            application: a collection of request handlers that do the
            actual work when a request is received).
        </p>

        <p>
            So, we need to look into the HTTP requests and extract the
            requested URL as well as the GET/POST parameters from them.
            It could be argued if that should be part of the router or
            part of the server (or even a module of its own), but let's
            just agree on making it part of our HTTP server for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the information we need is available through the
            <em>request</em> object which is passed as the first parameter
            to our callback function <em>onRequest()</em>. But to interpret
            this information, we need some additional Node.js modules, namely
            <em>url</em> and <em>querystring</em>.
        </p>

        <a name="head20"></a>
        <p>
            The <em>url</em> module provides methods which allow us to
            extract the different parts of a URL (like e.g. the requested
            path and query string), and <em>querystring</em> can in turn be
            used to parse the query string for request parameters:
        </p>
<pre>                               url.parse(string).query
                                           |
           url.parse(string).pathname      |
                       |                   |
                       |                   |
                     ------ -------------------
http://localhost:8888/start?foo=bar&amp;hello=world
                                ---       -----
                                 |          |
                                 |          |
              querystring(string)["foo"]    |
                                            |
                         querystring(string)["hello"]
</pre>

        <p>
            We can, of course, also use <em>querystring</em> to parse the
            body of a POST request for parameters, as we will see
            later.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's now add to our <em>onRequest()</em> function the logic
            needed to find out which URL path the browser requested:
        </p>

        <p>
            Fine. Our application can now distinguish requests based on the
            URL path requested - this allows us to map requests to our
            request handlers based on the URL path using our (yet to be
            written) router.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the context of our application, it simply means that we will
            be able to have requests for the <em>/start</em> and
            <em>/upload</em> URLs handled by different parts of our
            code. We will see how everything fits together soon.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, it's time to actually write our router. Create a new file
            called <em>router.js</em>, with the following content:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> route</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">pathname</span><span class="pun">)</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"About to route a request for "</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> pathname</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>exports</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">route </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> route</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            Of course, this code basically does nothing, but that's ok for
            now. Let's first see how to wire together this router with our
            server before putting more logic into the router.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our HTTP server needs to know about and make use of our router.
            We could hard-wire this dependency into the server, but because
            we learned the hard way from our experience with other
            programming languages, we are going to loosely couple server
            and router by injecting this dependency (you may want to read
            <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Martin Fowlers excellent post on Dependency Injection</a>
            for background information).
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's first extend our server's <em>start()</em> function in
            order to enable us to pass the route function to be used by
            parameter:
        </p>

                class="pln"> start</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            And let's extend our <em>index.js</em> accordingly, that is,
            injecting the route function of our router into the server:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> server </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"./server"</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="kwd">var</span><span
                class="pln"> router </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"./router"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br><br>server</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="pln">router</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">route</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span></pre>

        <p>
            Again, we are passing a function, which by now isn't any news
            for us.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we start our application now (<em>node index.js,
            as always</em>), and request an URL, you can now see from the
            application's output that our HTTP server makes use of our
            router and passes it the requested pathname:
        </p>
        <pre>bash$ node index.js
Request for /foo received.
About to route a request for /foo</pre>

        <p>
            (I omitted the rather annoying output for the /favicon.ico
            request).

        <h3>Execution in the kingdom of verbs</h3>

        <p>
            May I once again stray away for a while and talk about
            functional programming again?
        </p>

        <p>
            Passing functions is not only a technical consideration.
            With regard to software design, it's almost philosophical.
            Just think about it: in our index file, we could have passed
            the <em>router</em> object into the server, and the server
            could have called this object's <em>route</em> function.
        </p>

        <p>
            This way, we would have passed a <em>thing</em>, and the server
            would have used this thing to <em>do</em> something. Hey,
            router thing, could you please route this for me?
        </p>

        <p>
            But the server doesn't need the thing. It only needs to get
            something <em>done</em>, and to get something done, you don't
            need things at all, you need <em>actions</em>. You don't need
            <em>nouns</em>, you need <em>verbs</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding the fundamental mind-shift that's at the core of
            this idea is what made me really understand functional
            programming.
        </p>

        <p>
            And I did understand it when reading Steve Yegge's masterpiece
            <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a>.
            Go read it now, really. It's one of the best writings related
            to software I ever had the pleasure to encounter.
        </p>

        <a name="routing-to-real-request-handlers"></a>

        <h3>Routing to real request handlers</h3>

        <p>
            Back to business. Our HTTP server and our request router are
            now best friends and talk to each other as we intended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, that's not enough. "Routing" means, we want to
            handle requests to different URLs differently. We would like to
            have the "business logic" for requests to <em>/start</em>
            handled in another function than requests to <em>/upload</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right now, the routing "ends" in the router, and the router is
            not the place to actually "do" something with the requests,
            because that wouldn't scale well once our application becomes
            more complex.
        </p>

        <a name="continuereading"></a>
        <p>
            Let's call these functions, where requests are routed to,
            <em>request handlers</em>. And let's tackle those next, because
            unless we have these in place there isn't much sense in doing
            anything with the router for now.

              Hi there! Sorry to interrupt you.
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is Manuel Kiessling, I'm the author of this book.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have read that far, I guess I may assume that you like
              the book. I'm pretty sure you also like the fact that it's free,
              which is totally fine, and you can continue reading it for free,
              which also is totally fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I would like you to consider buying the eBook version
              of the book. It's a beautifully crafted package including a PDF,
              an ePub, and a MOBI file, which means you can read it on all
              kinds of eReaders out there like the Amazon Kindle, the Nook, or
              the Sony Reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the best thing about it is that it comes bundled with another
              great Node.js book: <em>"Hands-on Node.js"</em> by Pedro Teixeira. It's a
              complete reference that explains all the Node.js modules in great
              detail - it's perfect to dig deeper once you finished <em>The Node
              Beginner Book</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both books together would cost a total of $21.98, but we are offering
              it as a bundle for only <strong>$9.99</strong>.
              You can download it immediately, it's
              completely DRM-free, and you will receive any future updates for
              both books for free.

            New application part, new module - no surprise here. Let's
            create a module called requestHandlers, add a placeholder
            function for every request handler, and export these as
            methods of the module:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> start</span><span
                class="pun">()</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Request handler 'start' was called."</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span
                class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> upload</span><span
                class="pun">()</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"Request handler 'upload' was called."</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>exports</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> start</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"><br>exports</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">upload </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> upload</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            This allows us to wire the request handlers into the router,
            giving our router something to route to.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point we need to make a decision: do we hard-code usage
            of the requestHandlers module into the router, or do we want a
            bit more dependency injection? Although dependency injection,
            like every other pattern, shouldn't be used only for the sake
            of using it, in this case it makes sense to loosely couple the
            router and its request handlers, and thus making the router
            really reusable.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means we need to pass the request handlers from our server
            into our router, but this feels even more wrong, which is why
            we should go the whole way and pass them to the server from our
            main file, and passing it on to the router from there.
        </p>

        <p>
            How are we going to pass them? Right now we have two handlers,
            but in a real application, this number is going to increase and
            vary, and we sure don't want to fiddle around mapping requests
            to handlers in the router anytime a new URL / request handler
            is added. And having some
            <em>if request == x then call handler y</em> in the router
            would be more than ugly.
        </p>

        <p>
            A varying number of items, each mapped to a string (the
            requested URL)? Well, sounds like an associative array would be
            a perfect fit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, this finding is slightly disappointed by the fact that
            JavaScript doesn't provide associative array - or does it?
            Turns out, it's actually objects that we want to use if we need
            an associative array!
        </p>

        <p>
            There's a nice introduction to this at
            <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163419.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163419.aspx</a>,
            let me quote the relevant part:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                In C++ or C#, when we’re talking about objects, we're
                referring to instances of classes or structs. Objects have
                different properties and methods, depending on which
                templates (that is, classes) they are instantiated from.
                That's not the case with JavaScript objects. In JavaScript,
                objects are just collections of name/value pairs - think of a
                JavaScript object as a dictionary with string keys.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            If JavaScript objects are just collections of name/value pairs,
            how can they have methods? Well, the values can be strings,
            numbers etc. - or functions!
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, now finally back to the code. We decided we want to pass
            the list of requestHandlers as an object, and in order to
            achieve loose coupling we want to inject this object into the
            <em>route()</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start with putting the object together in our main file
            <em>index.js</em>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> server </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"./server"</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="kwd">var</span><span
                class="pln"> router </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span

                class="pln"> requestHandlers </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"./requestHandlers"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span
                class="pln"><br><br></span><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> handle </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{}</span><span
                class="pln"><br>handle</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="str">"/"</span><span
                class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> requestHandlers</span><span

                class="pun">[</span><span class="str">"/start"</span><span class="pun">]</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> requestHandlers</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"><br>handle</span><span
                class="pun">[</span><span class="str">"/upload"</span><span class="pun">]</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> requestHandlers</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">upload</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"><br><br>server</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">start</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="pln">router</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">route</span><span
                class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> handle</span><span class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            Although <em>handle</em> is more of a "thing" (a collection of
            request handlers), I propose we name it like a verb, because
            this will result in a fluent expression in our router, as we
            will see soon.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, it's really simple to map different URLs to the
            same request handler: by adding a key/value pair of
            <em>"/"</em> and <em>requestHandlers.start</em>, we can express
            in a nice and clean way that not only requests to
            <em>/start</em>, but also requests to <em>/</em> shall be
            handled by the <em>start</em> handler.
        </p>

        <p>
            After defining our object, we pass it into the server as an
            additional parameter. Let's change our <em>server.js</em> to
            make use of it:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span
                class="str">"http"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span
                class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> url </span><span class="pun">=</span><span

        <p>
            We've added the <em>handle</em> parameter to our
            <em>start()</em> function, and pass the handle object on to
            the <em>route()</em> callback, as its first parameter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's change the <em>route()</em> function accordingly, in our
            <em>router.js</em> file:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> route</span><span

                class="pln"> route</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            What we do here is, we check if a request handler for the given
            pathname exists, and if it does, we simply call the corresponding
            function. Because we can access our request handler functions
            from our object just as we would access an element of an
            associative array, we have this nice fluent
            <em>handle[pathname]();</em> expression I talked about earlier:
            "Please, <em>handle</em> this <em>pathname</em>".
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, that's all we need to wire server, router, and request
            handlers together! When starting our application and requesting
            <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>

            in our browser, we can prove that the correct request handler
            was indeed called:
        </p>
        <pre>Server has started.
Request for /start received.
About to route a request for /start
Request handler 'start' was called.</pre>

        <p>
            And opening <a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>
            in our browser proves that these requests, too, are indeed handled by
            the <em>start</em> request handler:
        </p>
        <pre>Request for / received.
About to route a request for /
Request handler 'start' was called.</pre>

        <a name="making-the-request-handlers-respond"></a>

        <h3>Making the request handlers respond</h3>

        <p>
            Beautiful. Now if only the request handlers could actually send
            something back to the browser, that would be even better,
            right?
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, the "Hello World" your browser displays upon
            requesting a page still comes from the <em>onRequest</em>

            function in our <em>server.js</em> file.
        </p>

        <p>
            "Handling request" means "answering requests" after all, thus
            we need to enable our request handlers to speak with the
            browser just like our <em>onRequest</em> function does.
        </p>

        <a name="how-to-not-do-it"></a>

        <h4>How to not do it</h4>

        <p>
            The straight-forward approach we - as developers with a
            background in PHP or Ruby - might want to follow is actually
            very deceitful: it works like a charm, seems to make a lot of
            sense, and then suddenly screws things up when we don't expect
            it.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I mean by "straight-forward approach" is this: make the
            request handlers <em>return()</em> the content they want to
            display to the user, and send this response data in the
            <em>onRequest</em> function back to the user.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's just do this, and then see why it's not such an overly
            good idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            We start with the request handlers and make them return what we
            would like to display in the browser. We need to change
            <em>requestHandlers.js</em> to this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> start</span><span
                class="pun">()</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span

                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="kwd">return</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
                class="str">"Hello Upload"</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span

                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">upload </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> upload</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            Good. Likewise, the router needs to return to the server what
            the request handlers return to him. We therefore need to edit
            <em>router.js</em> like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> route</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">handle</span><span class="pun">,</span><span

                class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"About to route a request for "</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> pathname</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="kwd">if</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="kwd">typeof</span><span
                class="pln"> handle</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="pln">pathname</span><span
                class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">===</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'function'</span><span class="pun">)</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span

                class="pun">]();</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="pun">}</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">else</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
                class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; console</span><span class="pun">.</span><span
                class="pln">log</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"No request handler found for "</span><span
                class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> pathname</span><span
                class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="kwd">return</span><span

                class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br><br>exports</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">route </span><span class="pun">=</span><span
                class="pln"> route</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            As you can see, we also return some text if the request could
            not be routed.
        </p>

        <p>
            And last but not least, we need to refactor our server to make
            it respond to the browser with the content the request handlers
            returned via the router, transforming <em>server.js</em> into:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> http </span><span

            If we start our rewritten application, everything works like

            results in "Hello Start" being displayed in the browser,
            requesting <a href="http://localhost:8888/upload" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/upload</a>
            gives us "Hello Upload", and <a href="http://localhost:8888/foo" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/foo</a>
            produces "404 Not found".
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, then why is that a problem? The short answer: because we
            will run into problems if one of the request handlers wants to make
            use of a non-blocking operation in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's take a bit more time for the long answer.
        </p>

        <a name="blocking-and-non-blocking"></a>

        <h4>Blocking and non-blocking</h4>

        <p>
            As said, the problems will arise when we include non-blocking
            operations in the request handlers. But let's talk about
            blocking operations first, then about non-blocking operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            And instead of trying to explain what "blocking" and
            "non-blocking" means, let's demonstrate ourselves what happens
            if we add a blocking operation to our request handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
            To do this, we will modify our <em>start</em> request handler
            to make it wait 10 seconds before returning its "Hello Start"
            string. Because there is no such thing as <em>sleep()</em> in
            JavaScript, we will use a clever hack for that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please modify <em>requestHandlers.js</em> as follows:

                class="pln"> upload</span><span class="pun">;</span></pre>

        <p>
            Just to make clear what that does: when the function
            <em>start()</em> is called, Node.js waits 10 seconds and only then
            returns "Hello Start". When calling <em>upload()</em>, it
            returns immediately, just like before.
        </p>

        <p>
            (Of course, you should imagine that instead of sleeping for
            10 seconds, there would be a real life blocking operation in
            <em>start()</em>, like some sort of long-running computation.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's see what this change does.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, we need to restart our server. This time, I ask you
            to follow a slightly complex "protocol" in order to see what
            happens: First, open two browser windows or tabs. In the first
            browser window, please enter <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
            into the address bar, but do not yet open this url!
        </p>

        <p>
            In the second browser window's address bar, enter <a href="http://localhost:8888/upload" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/upload</a>,
            and again, please do not yet hit enter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, do as follows: hit enter on the first window ("/start"),
            then quickly change to the second window ("/upload") and hit
            enter, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            What you will notice is this: The /start URL takes 10 seconds
            to load, as we would expect. But the /upload URL <em>also</em>
            takes 10 seconds to load, although there is no <em>sleep()</em>
            in the corrsponding request handler.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why? Because <em>start()</em> contains a blocking operation.
            We already talked about Node's execution model - expensive
            operations are ok, but we must take care to not block the Node.js
            process with them. Instead, whenever expensive operations must be
            executed, these must be put in the background, and their events
            must be handled by the event loop.
        </p>

        <p>
            And we will now see why the way we constructed the "request
            handler response handling" in our application doesn't allow us
            to make proper use of non-blocking operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once again, let's try to experience the problem first-hand by
            modifying our application.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are going to use our <em>start</em> request handler for this
            again. Please modify it to reflect the following (file
            <em>requestHandlers.js</em>):

        <p>
            As you can see, we just introduced a new Node.js module,
            <em>child_process</em>. We did so because it allows us to make
            use of a very simple yet useful non-blocking operation:
            <em>exec()</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            What <em>exec()</em> does is, it executes a shell command from
            within Node.js. In this example, we are going to use it to get
            a list of all files in the current directory ("ls -lah"),
            allowing us to display this list in the browser of a user
            requesting the <em>/start</em> URL.
        </p>

        <p>
            What the code does is straightforward: create a new variable
            <em>content</em> (with an initial value of "empty"), execute
            "ls -lah", fill the variable with the result, and return it.
        </p>

        <p>
            As always, we will start our application, and visit
            <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which loads a beautiful web page that displays the string
            "empty". What's going wrong here?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, as you may have already guessed, <em>exec()</em> does its
            magic in a non-blocking fashion. That's a good thing, because
            this way we can execute very expensive shell operations (like,
            e.g., copying huge files around or similar stuff) without
            forcing our application into a full stop as the blocking
            <em>sleep</em> operation did.
        </p>

        <p>
            (If you would like to prove this, replace "ls -lah" with a
            more expensive operation like "find /").
        </p>

        <p>
            But we aren't exactly happy with our elegant non-blocking
            operation, when our browser doesn't display its result, right?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, then, let's fix it. And while we are at it, let's try to
            understand why the current architecture doesn't work.
        </p>

        <p>
            The problem is that <em>exec()</em>, in order to work
            non-blocking, makes use of a callback function.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our example, it's an anonymous function which is passed as
            the second parameter to the <em>exec()</em> function call:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> </span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">error</span><span class="pun">,</span><span
                class="pln"> stdout</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> stderr</span><span
                class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; content </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> stdout</span><span class="pun">;</span><span
                class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span></pre>

        <p>
            And herein lies the root of our problem: our own code is
            executed synchronous, which means that immediately after
            calling <em>exec()</em>, Node.js continues to execute
            <em>return content;</em>. At this point, <em>content</em> is
            still "empty", due to the fact that the callback function
            passed to <em>exec()</em> has not yet been called - because
            <em>exec()</em> operates asynchronous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, "ls -lah" is a very inexpensive and fast operation (unless
            there are millions of files in the directory). Which is why the
            callback is called relatively expeditious - but it nevertheless
            happens asynchronously.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinking about a more expensive command makes this more
            obvious: "find /" takes about 1 minute on my
            machine, but if I replace "ls -lah" with "find /" in the
            request handler, I still immediately receive an HTTP response
            when opening the /start URL - it's clear that <em>exec()</em>
            does something in the background, while Node.js itself
            continues with the application, and we may assume that the
            callback function we passed into <em>exec()</em> will be called
            only when the "find /" command has finished running.
        </p>

        <p>
            But how can we achieve our goal, i.e. showing the user a list
            of files in the current directory?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, after learning how to <em>not</em> do it, let's discuss
            how to make our request handlers respond to browser requests
            the right way.
        </p>

        <a name="responding-request-handlers-with-non-blocking-operations"></a>

        <h4>Responding request handlers with non-blocking operations</h4>

        <p>
            I've just used the phrase "the right way". Dangerous stuff.
            Quite often, there is no single "right way".
        </p>

        <p>
            But one possible solution for this is, as often with Node.js,
            to pass functions around. Let's examine this.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right now, our application is able to transport the content
            (which the request handlers would like to display to the user)
            from the request handlers to the HTTP server by returning it
            up through the layers of the application (request handler -&gt;
            router -&gt; server).
        </p>

        <p>
            Our new approach is as follows: instead of bringing the content
            to the server, we will bring the server to the content. To be
            more precise, we will inject the <em>response</em> object (from
            our server's callback function <em>onRequest()</em>) through
            the router into the request handlers. The handlers will then be
            able to use this object's functions to respond to requests
            themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enough explanation, here is the step by step recipe on how to
            change our application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start with our <em>server.js</em>:

        <p>
            Instead of expecting a return value from the <em>route()</em>
            function, we pass it a third parameter, our <em>response</em>
            object. Furthermore, we removed any <em>response</em> method
            calls from the <em>onRequest()</em> handler, because we now
            expect <em>route</em> to take care of that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next comes <em>router.js</em>:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> route</span><span

        <p>
            Same pattern: instead of expecting a return value from our
            request handlers, we pass the <em>response</em> object on.
        </p>

        <p>
            If no request handler can be used, we now take care of
            responding with a proper "404" header and body ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            And last but not least, we modify <em>requestHandlers.js</em>:

        <p>
            Our handler functions need to accept the response parameter,
            and have to make use of them in order to respond to the
            request directly.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <em>start</em> handler will respond from within the
            anonymous <em>exec()</em> callback, and the <em>upload</em>
            handler still simply replies with "Hello Upload", but now
            by making use of the <em>response</em> object.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we start our application again (<em>node index.js</em>),
            this should work as expected.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you would like to prove that an expensive operation behind
            <em>/start</em> will no longer block requests for
            <em>/upload</em> from answering immediately, then modify your
            <em>requestHandlers.js</em> as follows:

        <h3>Serving something useful</h3>

        <p>
            Until now, what we have done is all fine and dandy, but we
            haven't created any value for the customers of our
            award-winning website.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our server, router, and request handlers are in place, thus now
            we can begin to add content to our site which allows our users
            to interact and walk through the use case of choosing a file,
            uploading this file, and viewing the uploaded file in the
            browser. For the sake of simplicity we will assume that only
            image files are going to be uploaded and displayed through the
            application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ok, let's take it step by step, but with most of the techniques
            and principles of JavaScript explained by now, let's at the
            same time accelerate a bit. This author likes to hear himself
            talking way too much anyways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, step by step means roughly two steps: We will first look
            at how to handle incoming POST requests (but not file uploads),
            and in a second step, we will make use of an external Node.js
            module for the file upload handling. I've chosen this approach
            for two reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, handling basic POST requests is
            relatively simple with Node.js, but still teaches us enough to
            be worth exercising it.
            <br>
            Second, handling file uploads (i.e.,
            multipart POST requests) is <em>not</em> simple with Node.js,
            and therefore is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but using
            an external module is itself a lesson that makes sense to be
            included in a beginner's tutorial.
        </p>

        <a name="handling-post-requests"></a>

        <h4>Handling POST requests</h4>

        <p>
            Let's keep this banally simple: We will present a textarea that
            can be filled by the user and submitted to the server in a POST
            request. Upon receiving and handling this request, we will
            display the content of the textarea.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The HTML for this textarea form needs to be served by our
            <em>/start</em> request handler, so let's add it right away, in
            file <em>requestHandlers.js</em>:

        <p>
            Now if this isn't going to win the Webby Awards, then I don't
            know what could. You should see this very simple form when
            requesting
            <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
            in your browser. If not, you probably didn't restart the
            application.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hear you: having view content right in the request handler is
            ugly. However, I decided to not include that extra level of
            abstraction (i.e., separating view and controller logic) in
            this tutorial, because I think that it doesn't teach us
            anything worth knowing in the context of JavaScript or Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's rather use the remaining screen space for a more
            interesting problem, that is, handling the POST request
            that will hit our <em>/upload</em> request handler when the
            user submits this form.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we are becoming expert novices, we are no longer
            surprised by the fact that handling POST data is done in a
            non-blocking fashion, by using asynchronous callbacks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Which makes sense, because POST requests can potentially be
            very large - nothing stops the user from entering text that is
            multiple megabytes in size. Handling the whole bulk of data in
            one go would result in a blocking operation.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make the whole process non-blocking, Node.js serves our code
            the POST data in small chunks, callbacks that are called upon
            certain events. These events are <em>data</em> (a new chunk of
            POST data arrives) and <em>end</em> (all chunks have been
            received).
        </p>

        <p>
            We need to tell Node.js which functions to call back to when
            these events occur. This is done by adding <em>listeners</em>
            to the <em>request</em> object that is passed to our
            <em>onRequest</em> callback whenever an HTTP request is
            received.
        </p>

        <p>
            This basically looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="pln">request</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">addListener</span><span
                class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"data"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span

                class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="com">// called when a new chunk of data was received</span><span
                class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">});</span><span class="pln"><br><br>request</span><span
                class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">addListener</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"end"</span><span
                class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">function</span><span
                class="pun">()</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span
                class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span
                class="com">// called when all chunks of data have been received</span><span
                class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">});</span></pre>

        <p>
            The question arises where to implement this logic. We currently
            can access the <em>request</em> object in our server only - we
            don't pass it on to the router and the request handlers, like
            we did with the <em>response</em> object.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my opinion, it's an HTTP servers job to give the application
            all the data from a requests it needs to do its job. Therefore,
            I suggest we handle the POST data processing right in the
            server and pass the final data on to the router and the request
            handlers, which then can decide what to do with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, the idea is to put the <em>data</em> and <em>end</em>
            event callbacks in the server, collecting all POST data chunks
            in the <em>data</em> callback, and calling the router upon
            receiving the <em>end</em> event, while passing the collected
            data chunks on to the router, which in turn passes it on to the
            request handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here we go, starting with <em>server.js</em>:

        <p>
            We basically did three things here: First, we defined that we
            expect the encoding of the received data to be UTF-8, we added
            an event listener for the "data" event which step by step
            fills our new <em>postData</em> variable whenever a new chunk
            of POST data arrives, and we moved the call to our router into
            the <em>end</em> event callback to make sure it's only called
            when all POST data is gathered. We also pass the POST data into
            the router, because we are going to need it in our request
            handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Adding the console logging on every chunk that is received
            probably is a bad idea for production code (megabytes of POST
            data, remember?), but makes sense to see what happens.
        </p>

        <p>
            I suggest playing around with this a bit. Put small
            amounts of text into the textarea as well as lots of text, and
            you will see that for the larger texts, the <em>data</em>
            callback is indeed called multiple times.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's add even more awesome to our app. On the /upload page,
            we will display the received content. To make this possible, we
            need to pass the <em>postData</em> on to the request handlers,
            in <em>router.js</em>:
        </p>

        <p>
            That's it, we are now able to receive POST data and use it in
            our request handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
            One last thing for this topic: what we pass on to the router
            and the request handlers is the complete body of our POST
            request. We will probably want to consume the individual fields
            that make up the POST data, in this case, the value of the
            <em>text</em> field.
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, for a beginner's tutorial, that's all there is to say
            about handling POST data.
        </p>

        <a name="handling-file-uploads"></a>

        <h4>Handling file uploads</h4>

        <p>
            Let's tackle our final use case. Our plan was to allow users to
            upload an image file, and display the uploaded image in the
            browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            Back in the 90's this would have qualified as a business model
            for an IPO, today it must suffice to teach us two things: how
            to install external Node.js libraries, and how to make use of
            them in our own code.
        </p>

        <p>
            The external module we are going to use is
            <em>node-formidable</em> by Felix Geisendörfer. It nicely
            abstracts away all the nasty details of parsing incoming file
            data. At the end of the day, handling incoming files is "only"
            about handling POST data - but the devil really <em>is</em> in
            the details here, and using a ready-made solution makes a lot
            of sense in this case.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to make use of Felix' code, the corresponding Node.js
            module needs to be installed. Node.js ships with its own
            package manager, dubbed <em>NPM</em>. It allows us to install
            external Node.js modules in a very convenient fashion. Given a
            working Node.js installation, it boils down to issuing
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><span class="pln">npm install formidable</span></pre>

        <p>
            on our command line. If the following output ends with
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash"><span class="pln">npm info build </span><span class="typ">Success</span><span
                class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> formidable@1</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="lit">0.9</span><span
                class="pln"><br>npm ok</span></pre>

        <p>
            then we are good to go.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <em>formidable</em> module is now available to our own
            code - all we need to do is requiring it just like one of the
            built-in modules we used earlier:
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> formidable </span><span
                class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> require</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"formidable"</span><span
                class="pun">);</span></pre>

        <p>
            The metaphor formidable uses is that of a form being submitted
            via HTTP POST, making it parseable in Node.js. All we need to
            do is create a new <em>IncomingForm</em>, which is an
            abstraction of this submitted form, and which can then be used
            to parse the <em>request</em> object of our HTTP server for the
            fields and files that were submitted through this form.
        </p>

        <p>
            The example code from the node-formidable project page shows
            how the different parts play together:
        </p>

        <p>
            If we put this code into a file and execute it through
            <em>node</em>, we are able to submit a simple form, including a
            file upload, and see how the <em>files</em> object, which is passed
            to the callback defined in the <em>form.parse</em> call, is
            structured:
        </p>
        <pre class="lang-js">received upload:

{ fields: { title: 'Hello World' },
  files:
   { upload:
      { size: 1558,
        path: '/tmp/1c747974a27a6292743669e91f29350b',
        name: 'us-flag.png',
        type: 'image/png',
        lastModifiedDate: Tue, 21 Jun 2011 07:02:41 GMT,
        _writeStream: [Object],
        length: [Getter],
        filename: [Getter],
        mime: [Getter] } } }</pre>

        <p>
            In order to make our use case happen, what we need to do is
            to include the form-parsing logic of formidable into our code
            structure, plus we will need to find out how to serve the
            content of the uploaded file (which is saved into the
            <em>/tmp</em> folder) to a requesting browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's tackle the latter one first: if there is an image file on
            our local hardrive, how do we serve it to a requesting browser?
        </p>

        <p>
            We are obviously going to read the contents of this file into
            our Node.js server, and unsurprisingly, there is a module for
            that - it's called <em>fs</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's add another request handler for the URL <em>/show</em>,
            which will hardcodingly display the contents of the file
            <em>/tmp/test.png</em>. It of course makes a lot of sense to
            save a real png image file to this location first.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are going to modify <em>requestHandlers.js</em> as follows:

            Fine. All we need to do now is
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    add a file upload element to the form which is served
                    at <em>/start</em>,
                </li>
                <li>
                    integrate node-formidable into the <em>upload</em>
                    request handler, in order to save the uploaded file to
                    <em>/tmp/test.png</em>,
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    embed the uploaded image into the HTML output of the
                    <em>/upload</em> URL.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Step 1 is simple. We need to add an encoding type of
            <em>multipart/form-data</em> to our HTML form, remove the
            textarea, add a file upload input field, and change the submit
            button text to "Upload file". Let's do just that in file
            <em>requestHandlers.js</em>:

            Great. The next step is a bit more complex of course. The first
            problem is: we want to handle the file upload in our
            <em>upload</em> request handler, and there, we will need to pass
            the <em>request</em> object to the <em>form.parse</em> call of
            node-formidable.
        </p>

        <p>
            But all we have is the <em>response</em> object
            and the <em>postData</em> array. Sad panda. Looks like we will have
            to pass the <em>request</em> object all the way from the server to
            the router to the request handler. There may be more elegant
            solutions, but this approach should do the job for now.
        </p>

        <p>
            And while we are at it, let's remove the whole <em>postData</em> stuff in
            our server and request handlers - we won't need it for handling the
            file upload, and it even raises a problem: we already "consumed"
            the <em>data</em> events of the <em>request</em> object in the
            server, which means that <em>form.parse</em>, which also needs to
            consume those events, wouldn't receive any more data from them
            (because Node.js doesn't buffer any data).
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start with <em>server.js</em> - we remove the postData
            handling and the <em>request.setEncoding</em> line (which is going
            to be handled by node-formidable itself), and we pass
            <em>request</em> to the router instead:

            Now, the <em>request</em> object can be used in our <em>upload</em>
            request handler function. node-formidable will handle the details
            of saving the uploaded file to a local file within <em>/tmp</em>,
            but we need to make sure that this file is renamed to
            <em>/tmp/test.png</em> ourselves. Yes, we keep things really simple
            and assume that only PNG images will be uploaded.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a bit of extra-complexity in the rename logic: the Windows
            implementation of node doesn't like it when you try to rename a
            file onto the position of an existing file, which is why we need to
            delete the file in case of an error.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's put the pieces of managing the uploaded file and renaming it
            together now, in file <em>requestHandlers.js</em>:

            And that's it. Restart the server, and the complete use case will
            be available. Select a local PNG image from your hardrive, upload
            it to the server, and have it displayed in the web page.

        <h2>Conclusion and outlook</h2>

        <p>
            Congratulations, our mission is accomplished! We wrote a simple
            yet full-fledged Node.js web application. We talked about
            server-side JavaScript, functional programming, blocking and
            non-blocking operations, callbacks, events, custom, internal
            and external modules, and a lot more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course, there's a lot of stuff we did not talk about:
            how to talk to a database, how to write unit tests, how to
            create external modules that are installable via NPM, or even
            something simple like how to handle GET requests.
        </p>

        <p>
            But that's the fate of every book aimed at beginners - it can't
            talk about every single aspect in every single detail.
        </p>

        <p>
            The good news is, the Node.js community is extremly vibrant
            (think of an ADHD kid on caffeine, but in a positive way),
            which means there are a lot of resources out there, and a lot
            of places to get your questions answered. The
            <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki">Node.js community wiki</a>
            and <a href="http://www.nodecloud.org/">the NodeCloud directory</a>
            are probably the best starting points for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, one more thing: If you would like to dig a bit further into JavaScript
            itself, you might consider reading
            <a href="http://manuel.kiessling.net/2012/03/23/object-orientation-and-inheritance-in-javascript-a-comprehensive-explanation/"><em>Object-orientation and inheritance in JavaScript: a comprehensive explanation</em></a>
            over at my blog.
